\subsection{Spin in a Magnetic Field}\label{subsec:spin-in-magnetic-field}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Nuclei with spin inherently exhibit a magnetic dipole moment, denoted as \( \vec{\mu} \). In classical terms, one can liken this to a minuscule bar magnet.

    \item Upon positioning such a magnet within an external magnetic field, characterized as \( \vec{B_0} = B_0 \hat{z} \), and presuming the spin axis (aligned with \( \vec{\mu} \)) is misaligned with \( \vec{B_0} \), it undergoes a torque, mathematically expressed as \( \vec{\tau} = \vec{\mu} \times \vec{B_0} \), and commences a precession around the magnetic field.

    \item The Larmor relation governs the frequency of this precession: \( f_0 = \frac{\omega_0}{2\pi} = \frac{\gamma B_0}{2\pi} \), where \( \gamma \) stands for the gyromagnetic ratio—a metric that ties the magnetic moment to the angular momentum. Significantly, this ratio is nucleus-specific. For instance, in the context of protons (or \( ^1H \) nuclei predominantly utilized in MRI), a 1 Tesla magnetic field corresponds to \( f_0 = 42.57 \, MHz \).

    \item Quantum mechanics introduces another layer of nuance. It posits that nuclear spin is quantized. Each specific nucleus possesses an intrinsic, fixed spin. Such quantization results in the dipole moment \( \vec{\mu} \) precessing, in the face of a uniform external magnetic field \( \vec{B_0} \), only at sharply defined angles relative to \( \vec{B_0} \).

    \item With respect to protons, \( \vec{\mu} \) adopts merely two orientations concerning \( \vec{B_0} \): either parallel (denoted as spin "up") or antiparallel (or spin "down") to \( \vec{B_0} \). These orientations carry distinct energy levels in the \( \vec{B_0} \) field. Such energy differentiation results in an imbalance, with "up" spins slightly outweighing the "down" spins, leading to a discernible macroscopic magnetization \( \vec{M} \) along \( \vec{B_0} \).

    \item An auxiliary magnetic field \( \vec{B_1} \), when tuned to the Larmor frequency \( f_0 \), can modulate the spin energy level populations, which tilts \( \vec{M} \) away from the z-direction, inducing a precession around \( \vec{B_0} \) at frequency \( f_0 \). For convenience, this behavior of \( \vec{M} \) is often assessed classically. The torque experienced by the magnetization due to the rotation of \( \vec{B_1} \) is given by \( \vec{\tau} = \vec{M} \times \vec{B_1} \).

    \item It's pivotal to understand motion in the “rotating frame”, a reference frame oscillating at the Larmor frequency around \( \vec{B_0} \) (or the z-axis). In this context, \( \vec{B_0} \) remains stationary in both the laboratory and rotating frames, implying the z'-axis in the rotating frame mirrors the z-axis in the lab frame. Consequently, the stationary \( \vec{B_1} \) in the rotating frame instigates \( \vec{M} \) to revolve about \( \vec{B_1} \), remaining within the z'y'-plane.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Measuring the Spin}\label{subsec:measuring-spin}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The magnetization vector \(\vec{M}\) can be manipulated using various radio-frequency (rf) pulse schemes.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Applying a rf pulse of amplitude \(B_1\) and duration \(\tau_P\) such that \(\vec{M}\) is rotated into the xy-plane results in a \(\pi/2\) pulse.
        \item Doubling \(\tau_P\) produces a \(\pi\) pulse, rotating \(\vec{M}\) into the negative z-direction.
    \end{itemize}

    \item The characteristic time for the magnetization in the xy-plane, \(M_{xy}\), to decay is denoted \(T_2\), known as the spin-spin relaxation time.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Over time, spins release the energy they obtained through the application of the \(\pi/2\) pulse and return to equilibrium.
        \item When the magnetization regrows along the z-axis to equilibrium value \(B_0\), it's characterized by time \(T_1\), called the spin-lattice relaxation time.
    \end{itemize}

    \item As \(\vec{M}\) precesses around \(\vec{B_0}\), any xy-plane component induces an emf in a surrounding sample coil.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item This is described by Faraday’s Law: \(\text{emf} = -N \frac{d\phi_B}{dt}\) due to \(\vec{M}\).
        \item The recorded signal from this precessing magnetization is termed the free induction decay (FID).
    \end{itemize}

    \item In a standard sample, individual magnetic moments contributing to \(\vec{M}\) are in varied magnetic environments.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item This is due to local, internal magnetic fields from neighboring spins and inhomogeneities in the \(B_0\) field.
        \item After magnetization is directed into the xy-plane, spins begin to dephase, reducing the net \(M\) vector in the xy-plane and consequently the induced signal.
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{figure}[h]

    \caption{Diagram after an RF pulse is applied. Source: Experiment 20 Manual (originally from Medical Imaging: Signals and Systems, Pearson Prentice Hall)}
    \label{fig:diagram2}
    \end{figure}

    \item Once \(\vec{M}\) has a component in the xy-plane, individual spins constituting this component start precessing at different rates. This causes spins to dephase, leading to a reduction in the overall magnitude of the xy-component of the magnetization vector \(\vec{M}\).
\end{itemize}

\section{Analysis}\label{sec:analysis}

\subsection{Finding Resonance}\label{subsec:finding-resonance}

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale = 0.78]{../images/B1}
    \caption{Free Induction Decay NMR signals for 90$^{\circ}$, 180$^{\circ}$, and 270$^{\circ}$ pulses}
    \label{fig:B1_FID}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Voltage at t = 0s}
\textbf{90\degree Pulse}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A 90\degree pulse is a pulse that is applied long enough to tip the magnetization vector by 90\degree from its initial direction (at a small angle with the positive z-axis) in the rotating frame:
    \begin{center}
        \sphere{(0.05, 0, 1)}{right}
        \sphere{(0, 1, 0)}{below}
    \end{center}
    \item Now, nearly half the spins are in the ``up'' state and the other half are in the ``down'' state.
    \item Since $\vec{M}$ is in the x-y plane, the z component of the magnetization vector vanishes:
    \[ M_z = 0 \]
    \item This is a higher energy state than the equilibrium state with the magnetization vector, $\vec{M}$, pointing along the positive z-axis.
    \item The receiver gain was adjusted so that the precessing $\vec{M}$ induced\footnote{According to Faraday's law.} a current in the coil as shown in the 90\degree trace of Figure~\ref{fig:B1_FID}.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{180\degree Pulse}
\begin{itemize}
    \item If we apply the pulse for twice as long (increase the pulse width to twice that of the 90\degree pulse), we rotate the magnetization vector by 180\degree:
    \begin{center}
        \sphere{(0.05, 0, 1)}{right}
        \sphere{(0.05, 0, -1)}{right}
    \end{center}
    \item Most of the spin are now in the ``down'' state.
    \item However, this magnetization vector doesn't induce current in the coils since the component in the x-y plane is nearly 0.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{270\degree Pulse}
\begin{itemize}
    \item This time, the pulse is applied long enough to rotate $\vec{M}$ by an additional 180\degree from the 90\degree case:
    \begin{center}
        \sphere{(0.05, 0, 1)}{right}
        \sphere{(0, -1, 0)}{below}
    \end{center}
    \item That is, $\vec{M}$ returns to the x-y plane but is anti-parallel to $\vec{M}$ in the 90\degree pulse case:
    \[ \vec{M}_{270^\circ} = -\vec{M}_{90^\circ} \]
    \item It hence precesses in the opposite sense of rotation as the 90\degree case\footnote{And vice versa.}.
    \item According to Faraday's law, the direction of the current $\vec{M}_{180^\circ}$ induces in the coil is opposite to that of $\vec{M}_{90^\circ}$.
    \item This is why we see a current that is -$I_{90^\circ}$ induced in the 270\degree case in Figure~\ref{fig:B1_FID}.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Free Induction Decay}
\begin{itemize}
    \item For all three pulses, we see that the signal vanishes over time.
    \item Recall that for the 90\degree and 270\degree pulses, the magnetization vector is in the x-y plane.
    \item Because of small variations in the magnetic field that the magnetic moments, $\vec{\mu}$, for each particle experience, the magnetic moments being to randomly dephase.
    \item They spread out in the x-y plane causing the magnetization vector and hence the induced current to vanish as a whole.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Free Induction Decay and $T_2$}\label{subsec:the-free-induction-decay-and-$t_2$}
\begin{itemize}
    \item In this section, we take a closer look at the FID observed in the 90\degree and 270\degree traces of Figure~\ref{fig:B1_FID} (for different samples).
    \item For the same 90\degree pulse, we have the following FID traces:
    \begin{figure}[h]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[scale = 0.78]{../images/B2}
        \caption{FID for the 90$^{\circ}$ pulse in water doped with CuSO$_4$, ethanol, and rubber}
        \label{fig:B2_FID}
    \end{figure}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Finding $T_2$}
\textbf{Analytically}
\begin{itemize}
    \item On plotting the traces in Figure~\ref{fig:B2_FID} on a semi-log graph (along with the best fit lines), we get:
    \begin{figure}[h!]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[scale = 0.78]{../images/B2_log_best_fit}
        \caption{$\ln(M_{xy}) = -\frac{t}{T_2^*} + \ln(M_0)$ plotted for the three traces in Figure~\ref{fig:B2_FID}}
        \label{fig:B2_FID_log_best_fit}
    \end{figure}

    \item We can find $T_2^*$ using the following equation:
    \[ M_{xy}(t) = M_0 e^{-\frac{t}{T_2^*}} \]
    Here, $M_{xy}(t)$ is the trace seen in Figure~\ref{fig:B2_FID},\\
    $M_0$ is the magnetization at $t=0$,\\
    $t$ is the time.
    \item We can take the $\ln$ of both sides to get:
    \[ \ln(M_{xy}) = \ln(M_0) + \ln\left(e^{-\frac{t}{T_2^*}}\right) \]
    \[ \ln(M_{xy}) = -\frac{t}{T_2^*} + \ln(M_0) \]
    \item Comparing this to $y = mx + c$, we see that the slope, $m$, is given by:
    \[ m = -\frac{1}{T_2^*} \]
    \[ \implies T_2^* = -\frac{1}{m} \]
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Sample Calculation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Consider $m = -328.236$s$^{-1}$ for Doped Water in Table~\ref{tab:B2_FID_log_best_fit_table}:
    \[ T_2^* = -\frac{1}{-328.236\text{s}^{-1}} \]
    \[ T_2^* = -\frac{1}{-328.236}\]
    \[ T_2^* = 0.003047\text{s} \]
    \item We can hence find $T_2^*$ from the slopes of the best fit lines in Figure~\ref{fig:B2_FID_log_best_fit} for the other samples:
    \begin{table}[h]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[scale = 0.78]{../images/B2_T2-crop}
        \caption{Slopes of best fit lines and calculated $T_2^*$}
        \label{tab:B2_FID_log_best_fit_table}
    \end{table}
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Estimation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item We can find an estimation for $T_2^*$ directly from the FID traces.
    \item For $t = T_2^*$, we have:
    \[ M_{xy}(T_2^*) = M_0 e^{-1} \]
    \[ \frac{M_{xy}(T_2^*)}{M_0} \approx 0.37 \]
    \[ M_{xy}(T_2^*) \approx 0.37 M_0 \]
    \item We can estimate the time at which $M_{xy}(T_2^*)$ is approximately $0.37 \cdot M_0$:
    \begin{table}[h]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[scale = 0.78]{../images/B2_slopes_estimate-crop}
        \caption{Estimate of $T_2^*$ using the initial magnetization}
